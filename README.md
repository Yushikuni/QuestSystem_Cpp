### Quest system made in C++

The Quest System project in C++ demonstrates a simple yet structured approach to implementing a dynamic quest system for RPG games. It includes various quest types, such as delivery, escort, gather, and kill, each represented by separate classes. The code uses object-oriented principles to manage quest states, player decisions, and quest progression. The gameplay includes interactions where players make choices that affect the story's outcome, such as collecting items, defeating monsters, and making critical decisions with NPCs like wolves and kings.
